## Short talks and Posters

{{ site.title }} invites the submission of abstracts for the short talk and poster tracks. Abstracts can also be simultaneously submitted for display at the main RECOMB Meeting poster session. Posters accepted to both RECOMB-Seq and RECOMB are welcome to be displayed at both meetings.

Please submit a 250-word abstract of your talk or poster that describes its primary results. Your submission should also include the author(s), their affiliations, the presenting author, the e-mail address of at least the contact author and the talk or poster title as requested by the submission system. The abstract should be plain text and should not contain any figures.

Please visit the [EasyChair]({{ site.links.easychair }}) system to submit your talk or poster abstract. The submission system will close on **{{ site.deadlines.short_talk_and_poster_submission }}**. Acceptance notifications will be sent out shortly after submission. For further questions, please contact the [{{site.pc_chair1}}]({{ site.links.pc_chair1 }}) or [{{site.pc_chair2}}]({{ site.links.pc_chair2 }}).
