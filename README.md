RECOMB Web Page Template

Forked from the [Minima Jekyll Template](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

Adapted by Can Alkan

Made it look similar to the Themefisher theme adapted by  Fatma Kahveci, Can Alkan, and Begüm Özemek for RECOMB 2023.

Most dates and links are defined as custom variables in _config.yml. Simply modify them, and all related pages should inherit the updates. We also have social\_links with variables, but it probably doesn't need updates. If some social channels are changed / added / removed, modify accordingly.
